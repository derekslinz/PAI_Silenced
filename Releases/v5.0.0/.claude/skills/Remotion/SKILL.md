name: Remotion
description: "Creates programmatic video with React via Remotion — builds compositions, sequences, and motion graphics rendered to MP. Uses useCurrentFrame() for all animation (no CSS animations). Integrates PAI_THEME constants from Theme.ts and Art skill aesthetic preferences for visual consistency. Render command: bunx remotion render {composition-id} ~/Downloads/{name}.mp. Output always to ~/Downloads/ for preview first. Tools: Render.ts (render, list compositions, create projects) and Theme.ts (PAI theme constants derived from Art). Reference docs: ArtIntegration.md (theme constants, color mapping), Patterns.md (code examples, presets), CriticalRules.md (what not to do), Tools/Ref-.md (pattern files covering core Remotion and Lambda rendering). Supports Lambda rendering. Rendering is CPU-intensive — use run_in_background. Primary workflow: ContentToAnimation (animate existing content). USE WHEN: video, animation, motion graphics, video rendering, React video, render video, animate content, make a short, create animations, video overlay, explainer video, animated explainer, content to video, programmatic video. NOT FOR static images, diagrams, or illustrations (use Art). NOT FOR audio cleanup (use AudioEditor)."

Remotion

Create professional videos programmatically with React.

Customization

Before executing, check for user customizations at:`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Remotion/`

Workflow Routing

| Trigger | Workflow |
| "animate this", "create animations for", "video overlay" | `Workflows/ContentToAnimation.md` |

Quick Reference

- Theme:Always use PAI_THEME from `Tools/Theme.ts`
- Art Integration:Load Art preferences before creating content
- Critical:NO CSS animations - use `useCurrentFrame()` only
- Output:Always to `~/Downloads/` first
- CLI:`bunx` always (never `npx`)

Render command:```bash
bunx remotion render {composition-id} ~/Downloads/{name}.mp```

Full Documentation

- Art integration:`ArtIntegration.md` - theme constants, color mapping
- Common patterns:`Patterns.md` - code examples, presets
- Critical rules:`CriticalRules.md` - what NOT to do
- Detailed reference:`Tools/Ref-.md` - pattern files covering core Remotion and Lambda rendering

Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Tools/Render.ts` | Render, list compositions, create projects |
| `Tools/Theme.ts` | PAI theme constants derived from Art |

Gotchas

- React-based video — component patterns differ from web React.Remotion has specific composition, sequence, and timing APIs.
- Rendering is CPU-intensive.Use `run_in_background: true` for render commands.
- Output goes to ~/Downloads/ firstfor preview. Same as images.
- NOT for static images— use Art skill for illustrations, diagrams, thumbnails.

Examples

Example : Create animated explainer```
User: "create a video showing how the Algorithm works"
→ Builds React composition with Remotion
→ Defines sequences, animations, timing
→ Renders to MPin background
→ Output to ~/Downloads/ for preview
```

Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Remotion","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
