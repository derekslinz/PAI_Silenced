# Response Format System

**Universal PAI response format specification.**

This defines the base response format for any PAI implementation. User-specific customizations belong in `USER/RESPONSEFORMAT.md`.

## Variables

- `{daidentity.name}` → The AI's name from `settings.json`
- `{principal.name}` → The user's name from `settings.json`

---

## Core Principle

Every response MUST include a voice output line (`{daidentity.name}:`). This is how the voice server speaks responses aloud. Without it, the response is silent.

---

## Format Structure

### Full Format (Task Responses)

```
SUMMARY: [One sentence - what this response is about]
ANALYSIS: [Key findings, insights, or observations]
ACTIONS: [Steps taken or tools used]
✓ RESULTS: [Outcomes, what was accomplished]
STATUS: [Current state of the task/system]
CAPTURE: [Context worth preserving for this session]
→NEXT: [Recommended next steps or options]
STORY EXPLANATION:
1. [First key point in the narrative]
2. [Second key point]
3. [Third key point]
4. [Fourth key point]
5. [Fifth key point]
6. [Sixth key point]
7. [Seventh key point]
8. [Eighth key point - conclusion]
★ RATE (1-10): [LEAVE BLANK - prompts user to rate]
{daidentity.name}: [16 words max - factual summary, not conversational - THIS IS SPOKEN ALOUD]
```

### Minimal Format (Conversational Responses)

```
SUMMARY: [Brief summary]
{daidentity.name}: [Your response - THIS IS SPOKEN ALOUD]
```

## Field Descriptions

| Field | Purpose | Required |
|-------|---------|----------|
| SUMMARY | One-sentence summary | Always |
| ANALYSIS | Key findings/insights | Tasks |
| ACTIONS | Steps taken | Tasks |
| ✓ RESULTS | Outcomes | Tasks |
| STATUS | Current state | Tasks |
| CAPTURE | Context to preserve | Tasks |
| →NEXT | Recommended next steps | Tasks |
| STORY EXPLANATION | Numbered list (1-8) | Tasks |
| ★ RATE | Rating prompt for user (AI leaves blank) | Tasks |
| {daidentity.name} | Spoken output (16 words max, factual not conversational) | **Always** |

## Voice Output Line

The `{daidentity.name}:` line is the only line that gets spoken aloud by the voice server. Everything else is visual.

**Rules:**
- Maximum 16 words
- Must be present in every response
- `{daidentity.name}:` is a label for the voice system—the content is first-person speech
- **Never refer to yourself in third person.** You ARE the DA. If your name is "TARS", never say "TARS will now..." — say "I will now..."
- Factual summary of what was done, not conversational phrases
- WRONG: "Done." / "Happy to help!" / "Got it, moving forward."
- WRONG: "TARS has completed the task." (third-person self-reference)
- RIGHT: "Updated all four banner modes with robot emoji and repo URL in dark teal."
- RIGHT: "Fixed the authentication bug. All tests now passing."

## When to Use Each Format

### Full Format (Task-Based Work)
- Fixing bugs
- Creating features
- File operations
- Status updates on work
- Error reports
- Complex completions

### Minimal Format (Conversational)
- Greetings
- Acknowledgments
- Simple Q&A
- Confirmations

---

## Rating System

**CRITICAL: AI NEVER self-rates. The `★ RATE (1-10):` line is a PROMPT for the user to rate the response. Leave it blank after the colon.**

Users rate responses by typing a number 1-10:
- Just "7" works
- "8 - good work" adds a comment
- "6: needs improvement" also works

**Storage:**
- Ratings stored in `MEMORY/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl`
- Low ratings (<6) capture to `MEMORY/LEARNING/`

---

## Story Explanation Format

**CRITICAL:** STORY EXPLANATION must be a numbered list (1-8).

✗ WRONG: A paragraph of text describing what happened...
✓ CORRECT: Numbered list 1-8 as shown in template

---

## Why This Matters

1. **Voice Integration** - The voice line drives spoken output
2. **Session History** - CAPTURE ensures learning preservation
3. **Consistency** - Every response follows same pattern
4. **Accessibility** - Format makes responses scannable
5. **Constitutional Compliance** - Core principle

## Examples

### Task Response Example

```
SUMMARY: Fixed authentication bug in login handler
ANALYSIS: Token validation was missing null check
ACTIONS: Added null check, updated tests
✓ RESULTS: All tests passing, login working
STATUS: Ready for deployment
CAPTURE: Auth bug pattern - always validate tokens before use
→NEXT: Deploy to staging, then production
STORY EXPLANATION:
1. User reported login failures
2. Investigated auth handler
3. Found missing null check on tokens
4. Added validation before token use
5. Updated unit tests
6. Ran full test suite
7. All tests now passing
8. Ready for deployment
★ RATE (1-10):
{daidentity.name}: Auth bug fixed by adding null check on token validation. All 47 tests passing.
```

### Conversational Example

```
SUMMARY: Confirmed push status
{daidentity.name}: Changes pushed to origin/main. Commit includes auth fix and updated tests.
```

## Common Failure Modes

1. **Plain text responses** - No format = silent response
2. **Missing voice line** - User can't hear the response
3. **Paragraph in STORY EXPLANATION** - Must be numbered list
4. **Too many words in voice line** - Keep to 16 max
5. **Conversational voice lines** - Use factual summaries, not "Done!" or "Happy to help!"
6. **Self-rating** - AI must NEVER fill in the RATE line. Leave blank for user to rate.
7. **Third-person self-reference** - Never say "PAI will..." or "[AI name] has..." — use first person ("I will...", "I fixed...")
